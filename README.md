# R-coursework

## Introduction

This R coursework repository is a set of practice with several example data and detailed topics. This coursework is targeted the biologists who would like to play their sequencing data on R session by themselves. 

The major targets for this R coursework are
  - The biologists who works mainly at wet lab and generating sequencing data
  - People who would like to start R from basics
  - The biologists who would like to understand how to do downstream analysis with their pre-processed sequencing data
  
The purposes of this R coursework are
  - To be familiar with R functions and packages
  - To understand how to deal with the data
  - To visualize the characteristic of data propoerly
  - To perform downstream analysis with the R packages

It is highly recommended to open on the laptop or desktop, rather than mobile. Readability is not so good on mobile and it is easy to practice on your R session of laptop or desktop.

Please do not copy the contents or use it as the material of course in schools.

## Contents

  - R notebook : In Rmd format (could modify on R) an html format (could be opened on Chrome or Internet explorer)
  - Example data
  
In some case, the practice may not have example data. In this case, the built-in dataset has been used for practice. Usually the example data is available on excel sheet, since most of the dataset would be tab- or comma-deliminated files.
