# R-coursework

## Introduction

This R coursework repository is not for any course in university. Originally, this R coursework is targeted the biologists who would like to start dealing with their own data on R by themselves, especially working mainly on the wet lab. Since the main purpose is starting from the very beginning, so it would be separated into several courses with following examples.

Please do not copy the contents or use it as the material of coursework. 

## Contents

  - R notebook : In Rmd format (could modify on R) an html format (could be opened on Chrome or Internet explorer)
  - Example data
  
In some case, the practice may not have example data. In this case, the built-in dataset has been used for practice. Usually the example data is available on excel sheet, since most of the dataset would be tab- or comma-deliminated files.
