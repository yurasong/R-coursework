# R-coursework

## Introduction

This R coursework repository is not from some course held in university, and all are generated for the people who would like to start dealing with their own data on R by themselves, especially the lab where I am working now.

Please do not copy the contents or use it as the material of coursework. 

Since it really targets the people who does not have any background of bioinformatics, statistics and computational science, the notebook will be start from really basic. 

## Contents
