# R-coursework

## Introduction

This R coursework repository is not from some course held in university, and all are generated for the people in my lab who would like to start dealing with their own data on R by themselves. Please do not copy it or use it as the material of coursework. 

Since it really targets the people who does not have any background of bioinformatics, statistics and computational science, the notebook will be start from really basic. 

## Contents
